## Modules Overview

### 00_Introduction to C++ (Part 1)
Introduction to basic syntax, data types, control structures, and functions in C++.

### 01_Introduction to C++ (Part 2) – Dynamic Memory Allocation
Covers pointers, memory allocation (`new` and `delete`), and understanding dynamic memory management.

### 02_Classes & Objects
Explores object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, destructors, and member functions.

### 03_Template Class and Operator Overloading
Understanding template classes for generic programming and operator overloading for custom behavior of operators.

### 04_Unsorted Lists (Array Based)
Implementation of unsorted lists using arrays, including operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### 06_Stacks (Array Based)
Stack data structure implementation using arrays, with stack operations: `push`, `pop`, and `peek`.

### 07_Queues (Array Based)
Queue data structure implementation using arrays, focusing on `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and circular queue.

### 10_Unsorted Lists (Linked List Based)
Unsorted list implementation using singly linked lists, including node operations.

### 11_Sorted Lists (Linked List Based)
Implementation of sorted linked lists, covering insertion, deletion, and sorting operations.

### 12_Recursion
Introduction to recursion, its principles, use cases, and optimization techniques.

### 13_Binary Search Tree
Binary search tree implementation, including insertion, deletion, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and search operations.

### 14_Priority Queue
Priority queue implementation, focusing on heap structures and priority-based insertion/deletion.
